      <p>E-mail adress: Kalininfree@gmail.com</p>
      <p>I want to discover a new profession of a web developer and start learning the javascript programming language. 
        I'm new to this field, and only managed to learn the basics of html and css, but I really want to learn everything related to development.</p>
      <p>These will be my first courses, if I pass such a tough selection, of course. I don't have any developer skills, 
        and I only speak English with google translator, but I'm ready to absorb all the information and try with all my might to learn.</p>
